# Change Log — iOS Political Transcript Platform

This file tracks implementation progress and important workspace changes for the iOS Political Transcript Platform project.

Date: 2025-08-31

- [ ] Initial scaffold created: planning, details, and prompt files under `.copilot-tracking`.

Notes:
- I prepared a helper script `scripts/create_and_push_repo.sh` and a short `README.md` with instructions to create a GitHub repository named `polibase_ios_app` and push the current workspace. Run the script locally (see `README.md`) — it requires a logged-in `gh` CLI or an exported `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_OWNER` environment variables.
- Remote repository creation and push must be executed from your machine because authentication is required.

Please update this file with commit hashes and remote repo URL once the push completes.
